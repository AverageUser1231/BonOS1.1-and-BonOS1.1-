## Disclaimer
- **Windows Security Warning**: When running the script, Windows may flag it as harmful or potentially unsafe.

Please be aware of this warning.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: This project is intended for educational and fun purposes only. Make sure to **save all your work** before running commands like shutdown or restart.
- **No Harmful Intentions**: The script is not a virus or malware, but always exercise caution when running any script, especially if you’re not familiar with its contents.
